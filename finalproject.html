<main><h2>What is Robotic Engineering</h2>
<p> Robotic engineers use computer aided design and drafting(CADD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems to perform their tasks . Robotics engineers use computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems to perform their tasks. Robotics research engineers design robotic systems and research methods to manufacture them economically. In short terms they create robots for dangerous tasks where no other human can do.</p>
