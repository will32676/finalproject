<main><h2> why I like Robotics</h2>
<p> I've liked them since when I was a kid of they worked by and made by us and how they are programed to work in a certain function. Like recent robots like "HANDLE" a robot that is programed to be quite mobile, it travel at 9 mph and can jump up at far distance. There is also another robot named "ALTAS" That move like a human, can 10 lbs, and recover from falling down. or SPOT, I could go on and on but you get the point I LOVE ROBOTS!!!</p>
